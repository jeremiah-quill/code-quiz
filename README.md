Welcome to my quiz app! After clicking start, a timer begins to count down and the user is presented with a set of coding questions, 1 after another.  If the user answers a question incorrectly a penalty is subtracted from the timer.  When the timer reaches 0 or all of the questions have been answered the user is shown a game over screen with their score.  The user is able to either play again, or enter their initials into a highscore table.  This highscore table persists the scores through local storage so they are saved through a page refresh. A few additional details about this app include:

* On answering a question, the user is shown a quick correct/incorrect message on the screen while the next question is presented
* The highscores table is sorted by questions answered correctly, then by time remaining.  This allows for the possibility of a user beating a tied score based on how fast they completed the quiz
* This app functions correctly and appears clean on all screen sizes

The following are screenshots of the finished product:
